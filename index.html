            <p>The corona plague is a persistent global epidemic of corona virus. The virus, a strain of SARS-CoV-2, is thought to have spread from infected animals to humans, infecting hundreds of millions of people, of which over 200 million have been verified, and killing over 4 million. Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, but it has been claimed that cases of infection have appeared even earlier. By mid-February 2020 it began to spread rapidly all over the world.</p>
            <p>Countries around the world have responded to the epidemic through guidelines to maintain social distance, impose restrictions on movement and gatherings, impose closures and curfews, cancel events and close all non-essential institutions. Targeted efforts have also been made to locate and isolate patients and carriers, protect medical staff, and rapidly increase hospital capacity, including the construction of special hospitalization frameworks for Corona patients. During the plague there was a time when a third of humanity - about 2.6 billion people - were required to stay in homes under conditions of closure.</p>
            <p>In September 2020 and during 2021, dozens of mutations in the corona virus were discovered that affected new outbreaks of the disease around the world. At the end of 2020, mass vaccination against the virus began to be given to the world's population.</p>

            <p>The verified cases of infection and the detailed deaths refer to the people who have been tested for coronary heart disease, as officially reported by the various countries. Different countries have different policies regarding the level of symptoms required to perform a test, and some do not test people who show only mild symptoms. In some countries of the world only a few reports have been reported, and some countries do not report at all.</p>
