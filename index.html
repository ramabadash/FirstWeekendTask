            <p>The <code>corona</code> plague is a persistent global epidemic of <code>corona</code> virus. The virus, a strain of SARS-CoV-2, is thought to have spread from infected animals to humans, infecting hundreds of millions of people, of which over 200 million have been verified, and killing over 4 million. Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, but it has been claimed that cases of infection have appeared even earlier. By mid-February 2020 it began to spread rapidly all over the world.</p>
            <p>Countries around the world have responded to the epidemic through guidelines to maintain social distance, impose restrictions on movement and gatherings, impose closures and curfews, cancel events and close all non-essential institutions. Targeted efforts have also been made to locate and isolate patients and carriers, protect medical staff, and rapidly increase hospital capacity, including the construction of special hospitalization frameworks for <code>Corona</code> patients. During the plague there was a time when a third of humanity - about 2.6 billion people - were required to stay in homes under conditions of closure.</p>
            <p>In September 2020 and during 2021, dozens of mutations in the <code>corona</code> virus were discovered that affected new outbreaks of the disease around the world. At the end of 2020, mass vaccination against the virus began to be given to the world's population.</p>

            <p>The verified cases of infection and the detailed deaths refer to the people who have been tested for coronary heart disease, as officially reported by the various countries. Different countries have different policies regarding the level of symptoms required to perform a test, and some do not test people who show only mild symptoms. In some countries of the world only a few reports have been reported, and some countries do not report at all.</p>

            <header><h2>Infection and symptoms</h2></header>
            <p>The virus is transmitted from person to person when a carrier breathes out a respiratory splash and aerosols floating in the air, which contain the virus. Another person can inhale the respiratory splash and aerosols. They can also land on the eyes, nose and mouth, especially in the case of coughing and sneezing. Infection from infected surfaces and contact of the hands with the eyes, nose and mouth is not considered common.</p>
            <p>The symptoms are usually fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms, more unique to the disease than the flu, have also been reported, including temporary loss of taste and smell, as well as finger bleeding. Complications may include pneumonia, accumulation of blood clots and kidney failure. Patient care focuses on relieving symptoms and supportive care.</p>
            <p>The time from validating the patients to the deterioration of some to a moderate-severe condition is about 3 weeks. The recovery process is particularly long, ranging from about two weeks in mild cases to six weeks in difficult cases. It was reported that some recoverers continued to experience physical symptoms such as weakness, pain and changes in the sense of taste, as well as mental consequences.</p>

            <header><h2>The spread of the virus in the world</h2></header>
            <p>During February 2020, the virus began to spread outside China, and by the end of February, the number of infections worldwide was about 89,000, of which about 80,000 were in China and only 9,000 in over 60 countries. But since the beginning of March 2020, the number of people infected has been growing rapidly, and by mid-March it has spread to more than 150 countries, mainly European countries. As of mid-March, both the number of people infected and the number of deaths in the world exceeded that in China. The main focal points of expansion at the end of March were mainly Italy, Spain and Iran. At the same time, the plague began to spread rapidly in the United States, and the number of reported daily infections there reached more than 15,000 at the end of March. The number of new cases per day in the world exceeded the 60,000 level towards the end of March. On March 26, the number of infections worldwide was more than 500,000, and more than 24,000 deaths.</p>

            <p>Crisis management is divided into five main types:<br>
                Closing boundaries. In addition, those who entered were charged with isolation for a period (usually two weeks).<br>
                Measures designed to slow the spread of the virus by extensive movement restrictions and an overall reduction in the number of encounters between residents of the country or extensive areas in it.<br>
                Measures to reduce virus infection during a session. Different countries have required or encouraged in various ways their citizens to use masks and disinfectants, to wash their hands and sometimes also to use gloves and to avoid close contact and in particular handshaking. Special emphasis is placed on the protection of medical staff and nursing home staff.<br>
                Measures to stop adhesion chains by early detection of carriers and their isolation. For this purpose, people who arrived on the flight were sent to isolation, especially from countries known to be infected with the virus; Epidemiological investigations have been conducted to identify hotspots, locate people who may be carriers, send them to isolation and inspect them. Some were helped by applications.<br>
                Since the outbreak, the world's leading medical companies have been working to develop drugs and vaccines for COVID-19.
